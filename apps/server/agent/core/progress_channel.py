"""In-band progress channel for tool calls that want to stream live sub-events.

The openai-agents SDK owns the model+tool loop: while a tool's ``on_invoke_tool``
callback runs, the consumer of ``Runner.run_streamed().stream_events()`` is parked
awaiting the next SDK event, so a long-running tool (e.g. ``parallel_execute``)
cannot surface intermediate progress through the normal SDK event flow.

This module provides a tiny context-local emitter the runner installs before
starting the SDK run. A tool executing inside the SDK background task can then
call :func:`emit_progress` to hand a pre-built workflow/SSE event back to the
runner, which interleaves it into the outbound stream.

Design notes:
- The channel holds a *callable* (not a queue) so the runner decides how to
  enqueue (it tags the event for its own merge loop). This keeps the channel
  generic and free of any runner/SDK imports.
- ``contextvars`` propagate into the SDK background task because
  ``asyncio.create_task`` (used by ``Runner.run_streamed``) copies the current
  context at creation time. The runner installs the emitter *before* starting
  the run, so the tool's context copy sees it.
- :func:`emit_progress` never raises and is a no-op when no channel is active
  (e.g. tools invoked directly from unit tests), so callers can emit freely
  without guarding.
