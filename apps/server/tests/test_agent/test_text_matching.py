"""Regression tests for approximate text matching safety.

Covers:
- The work-budget guard that stops find_approximate_match from spinning the
  CPU (and blocking the event loop) on large chapters.
- The ambiguity guard that refuses to auto-apply a merely-similar window when a
  different, distant passage scores nearly as high.
- Preservation of the legitimate word-error match on reasonably-sized content.
